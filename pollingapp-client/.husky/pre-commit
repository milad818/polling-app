# ── Pre-commit hook ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Step 1 – lint-staged
#   Runs ESLint (--fix) and Prettier (--write) ONLY on the files you have
#   staged for this commit. Working on a subset is much faster than linting
#   the whole repo and avoids noisy diffs from unrelated files.
#
# Step 2 – TypeScript type-check
#   Runs `tsc --noEmit` against tsconfig.app.json.  ESLint only type-checks
#   one file at a time; the full compiler sees cross-file relationships
#   (missing imports, wrong generics, renamed interfaces, etc.) that
#   per-file analysis would miss.  `--noEmit` skips writing output files —
#   we just want the diagnostics.

npx lint-staged
npm run type-check
